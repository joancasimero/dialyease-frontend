# Connection Lost Asset Replacement

The original `connection-lost.gif` (571.60 MB) was too large for GitHub and has been removed.

## Recommended Replacements:

### Option 1: Use CSS Animation
Create a pure CSS animation instead of a large GIF:

```css
/* Add to your CSS file */
.connection-lost-animation {
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  border: 8px solid #f3f3f3;
  border-top: 8px solid #ff6b6b;
  border-radius: 50%;
  animation: spin 2s linear infinite;
}

@keyframes spin {
  0% { transform: rotate(0deg); }
  100% { transform: rotate(360deg); }
}
```

### Option 2: Use a Smaller GIF
- Keep file size under 1MB
- Optimize using tools like ezgif.com or gifsicle
- Reduce dimensions to maximum 400x400px

### Option 3: Use SVG Animation
Create a lightweight SVG animation that's infinitely scalable and small in file size.

## Implementation in React:
```jsx
// ConnectionLost.js
const ConnectionLost = () => (
  <div className="connection-lost">
    <div className="connection-lost-animation"></div>
    <p>Connection Lost. Trying to reconnect...</p>
  </div>
);
```

Choose the option that best fits your design needs while keeping file sizes manageable.
